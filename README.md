# lda-lab

This is a simple Spring MVC Boot project that explores LDA topic models.

Clone and run `./gradlew bootRun` to start it locally.

This project is heavily indebted to Andrew Goldstone's dfr-browser https://agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser/ for inspiration in visualization methods and the implementation of a Gibb's sampler in David Mimno's jsLDA https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/index.html.
